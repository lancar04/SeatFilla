##Technologies
This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.
Feathers sits on top of some very powerful javascript frameworks such as Node.js, SocketIO and Express.js. 

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies
    
    ```
    cd path/to/CapstoneProject; npm install
    ```

3. Start your app
    
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g feathers-cli             # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers generate model                 # Generate a new Model
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
